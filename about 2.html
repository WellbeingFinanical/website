        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Wellbeing Financial was founded on a simple but powerful belief: every Canadian deserves access to the same level of financial expertise that was once available only to the wealthy. We recognized that most people were missing out on significant financial opportunities simply because they didn't have the time, knowledge, or resources to constantly monitor the ever-changing financial landscape.</p>
            
            <p>Our team of financial technology experts, data scientists, and consumer advocates came together to solve this problem. We developed an AI-powered platform that acts as a personal financial expert, working tirelessly to identify opportunities for better rates, terms, and financial products tailored to each individual's unique situation.</p>
            
            <p>Today, we're proud to be helping thousands of Canadians take control of their financial future, one smart decision at a time.</p>
