## 🚨 Critical Legal/Compliance Items Requiring Action

### PIPEDA Compliance Requirements
**Status:** 🔴 NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Target:** Before production launch  

**Current Issue:**  
Security page claims "building toward full regulatory compliance" but we need to implement actual PIPEDA compliance mechanisms before making any compliance claims.

**Required Actions:**

- [ ] Create comprehensive Privacy Policy document
- [ ] Document data collection, use, and storage practices  
- [ ] Define data retention and deletion policies

#### 2. Technical Implementation
- [ ] Implement data subject rights system (access, correction, deletion requests)

- [ ] Create data processing records system
- [ ] Implement consent management mechanisms

#### 3. Operational Procedures  
- [ ] Train team on PIPEDA requirements

#### 4. Legal Review

- [ ] Review current website claims for compliance accuracy
- [ ] Get guidance on provincial privacy law requirements
- [ ] Understand registration/notification requirements

**Estimated Cost:** $5,000-$15,000 for initial legal consultation and setup
