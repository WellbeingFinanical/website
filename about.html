        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p class="fade-in-section">Our name says it all: <strong>Wellbeing Financial.</strong> We didn't choose "optimization" or "maximization" or any other cold, corporate term. We chose <em>wellbeing</em> because your financial health should support your life, not consume it.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-section"><strong>That's why our promise is simple but powerful:</strong> "We relentlessly pursue your financial wellbeing." Not just better rates or smarter products, but genuine <em>financial</em> wellbeing in everything we do.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-section">For too long, Canadians have had to become <strong>financial experts</strong> just to get a fair deal. You're expected to research dozens of lenders, compare complex terms, and somehow know when better rates become available—<em>all while managing your actual life.</em></p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-section"><strong>That stops now.</strong></p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-section">Wellbeing Financial built an AI assistant so powerful it's like having a <strong>personal financial expert in your pocket</strong>—constantly evaluating every mortgage option, tirelessly seeking ways to save you money, every second of every day. Now, picture that same AI evaluating <em>all</em> your loans and credit products at home. And it all comes together in <strong>one simple dashboard</strong>, presented in clear, understandable language.</p>
            
            <h3 class="fade-in-section">We do the work you don't have time for:</h3>
            <p class="fade-in-section">While you're focused on your life, our AI relentlessly monitors the entire Canadian financial market. It tracks rate changes across mortgages, personal loans, auto loans, and credit cards. It learns your situation and preferences. It continuously analyzes thousands of financial products at a volume and frequency that wouldn't be possible to do manually.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-section"><strong>The result?</strong> You get the financial insights that were once available only to people with personal wealth managers, except it's automated, always on, and designed for everyday Canadians.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-section">We're not just another app showing you the same rates everyone else sees. We're building the intelligent system that helps you avoid leaving money on the table because you didn't know a better option existed.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in-section">No need to imagine, experience it today.</p>

            <h3>Mortgage Optimization</h3>
            <p>We analyze mortgage rates, terms, and refinancing opportunities across every lender in Canada. Our AI doesn't play favorites—it finds you the best deal, regardless of which bank offers it.</p>
            
            <h3>Credit Card Analysis</h3>
            <p>Our system evaluates every credit card offer across all institutions, comparing rewards programs and terms based purely on what maximizes value for your specific spending patterns.</p>
            
            <h3>Loan Comparisons</h3>
            <p>Whether it's personal loans, auto loans, or lines of credit, we treat every lender as just another source of capital. Our recommendations are based solely on who offers you the best terms, not who pays us the most.</p>
            
            <h3>Educational Insights</h3>

                <li><strong>Customer-First Always:</strong> Our only loyalty is to you. We evaluate every financial product purely on its merit for your situation, treating all lenders equally. To us, they're just different sources of capital, and we'll always recommend whoever offers you the best deal.</li>
